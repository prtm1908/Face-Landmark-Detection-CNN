# Face-Landmark-Detection-CNN

This repository contains a deep learning project that predicts facial landmarks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Facial landmarks are key points on a person's face, such as the corners of the eyes, nose, and mouth. This project uses a CNN architecture to detect and predict these landmarks, which can be useful in various applications, including facial recognition, emotion analysis, and augmented reality.
